        I chose to build a professional based website for many reasons. As I go through college, I gaining daily knowledge on what the real world will consist of post graduation. By choosing this specific project, I am granting myself another skill set that will benefit me as I look to get into the workforce and from then on out. Also, while  creating the project, I will be forced to look at my past successes and do a reality check on myself to see what I’ve already done and realize what I’m capable of completing.

         Throughout my life, I have made strides to accomplish many things worth noting in my family specifically. I’ve always pride myself on my academic accomplishments over my athletic because I refuse to let them overshadow each other as if one represents my identity more than the other. Throughout my jobs and volunteer work, I learned many things and I am very grateful for the things that I’ve learned.
