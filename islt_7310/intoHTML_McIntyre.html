     Hello! My name is Eryka McIntyre and I am student-athlete at the University of Missouri. I was born in Oakland, California in 2001 and moved to Texas around 2004 when the crime rates rose to an all time high, which led my dad into looking for a job transfer. Once I moved to Texas, I took up an interest in soccer, which led me to the position that I am in today. I am a Business major with a minor in TAM, however Iâ€™ve had my fair share of exploring through some of the most popular majors that Mizzou has to offer. With this course, I am hoping to gain the skills and basic knowledge of technology and computers while also enhancing the skills I need to be successful in the future. I have no prior knowledge with this area in technology. I often make clothes in my free time, I just never knew how to present myself online so hopefully this class will give me the chance to help turn my hobby into a career.
