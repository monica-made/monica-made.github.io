    <h1>Hello! My name is Eryka McIntyre, but please feel free to call me Monica!</h1>
               <h3>Welcome to my website, stay as long as you’d like!</h3>

     <p> I was born in Oakland, California in 2001 and moved to Texas around 2004 when the crime rates rose to an all time high, which led my dad into looking for a job transfer. Once I moved to Texas, I took up an interest in soccer, which led me to the position that I am in today. I am a Business major with a minor in TAM, however I’ve had my fair share of exploring through some of the most popular majors that Mizzou has to offer, while also being a hardworking student-athlete.</p>

Your favorite color and the reasons why it's your favorite is how you are as a person. I am a very out going person who enjoys the social scene. </blockquote
