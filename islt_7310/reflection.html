    <h1> I am a young aspiring black woman! </h1>
    <h3> Without the African American women who paved the way for the black girls of this here present day, I would not have the knowledge, power, or creativity that I posses today. I owe my pending successes to my curiosity and open-minded nature that was passed down through generations and generations of women just like me.</h3>

        Throughout my life, I have explored many things that interest me and took on numerous hobbies. As I got older, I took a vast interest in fashion and magazine productions. I’ve always enjoyed the idea of working for a magazine company one day by either editing the magazine or working in the closet of the company. Currently, the jobs I have worked so far include a lot of social work and also working in fashion/designs. I’m looking to gain more experience in the fashion industry to gain more knowledge and experience.

        Right now, I am working on earning my bachelors degree in business while also working towards turning my TAM minor into a major. With these degrees under my belt, I have hopes of coming back to school one day to go to law school. I have many dreams and aspirations and with my work ethic, I belive that I can turn these ideas into a reality.

        Being an African American woman in America today is one of the most challenging things I will ever experience. Due to my skin color and cultural background, I will and have gone through numerous hardships that have shaped me into the person I am today. However, these hardships have never stoped me from chasing my dreams. If anything, they have made the chase more rewarding and the end journey just that much sweeter.
